# Project Description

A karma / morality score tracking application built using the React Framework (CSS, JSX)

## Overview

This application allows users to track decisions they've made (and the weight those decisions hold) throughout a video game playthrough.  The idea was inspired heavily by the karma system in the Fallout franchise, but there was something always missing in their envisionment of the system.  You'd always have the ability to see if you had good, neutral or bad karma, but there wasn't ever a specified number attached to show how close to the line you are at that moment.  My application does exactly that, and although the proposed game isn't real, the code could easily be used on anything that tracks progress from 0 - 100.  The user has a score as well as a colored bar that visually represents how they're doing based on their choices thus far.

## My Experience

After working with Angular, I was curious about other frameworks.  I decided to give React a shot, as it was one of the main three for JavaScript.  I found a lot more enjoyment learning React than I did with Angular, but I'm not certain the reason why exactly.  It could be the actual subjective quality of the frameworks, or I could have a bias due to struggling more with Angular as my first framework experience.  As I learned React, it seemed a lot more intuitive and I felt like I could pick up even the more complex concepts easier than before.  React Hooks were a huge life-saver when it came to learning these concepts as I was able to utilize hooks like useState(), useEffect() and useReducer().  I also tested out useContext(), but opted to store the global state with the App.js file instead.  I think if this ever turned into a larger application, though, I'd most likely transfer that code over into a context file.

## Final Remarks

As I said in the previous section, I thoroughly enjoyed using React.  I actually made a project prior to the Karma Tracker, but I was confused on a lot of details at the time.  When I realized where I messed up, I decided it'd make more sense to create a new project instead and use the first as an example of what not to do.  I hope to continue using React in the future, but even if I find myself using a different framework, I feel as though I also gained more of a general understanding of transferrable concepts such as components and state management.
